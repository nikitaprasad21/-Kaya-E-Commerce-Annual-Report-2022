### Introduction 
 
Kaya E-Store is a Clothing E-Store who sells different category clothes on different channels. They had a very good sales in last three months but they wants to create Quarterly Sales Report foe 2022 to understand their customers and grow sales in till last Quarter.

### Work Process

The dataset was uncleaned and dirty so I used Excel to clean the datset for Quarterly Analysis. Then I used Tableau to visualize data to predict below mention observations and recommendations.


### Analytics

I designed Quarterly Sales Report Dashboard to get insights on Categories Wise Distribution of Sales in the months of April, May, June using Tableau.

Here is the glimpse of dashboard.

Top 3 observations made are as mentioned below:

1. "April" has the highest sales and June has lowest sales in 2022.
2. "Adult Women" Consumers are Kaya E-Store's Elite Customers because they bring approximately 60% - 70% of the sales.
3. "Set" and "Bottom" are the highest and lowest seling product respectively.

###### Note: Do check all the obsevations made from the dashboard to better understand the recommendations made for the client.
